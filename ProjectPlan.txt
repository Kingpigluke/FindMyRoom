Find My Room — 2-Week Sprint Plan
Sprint length: 2 weeks
Total sprints: 6 (12 weeks total)

Sprint cadence:
Week 1: Build
Week 2: Build + test + demo

Every sprint ends with something that works.

Sprint 1 (Weeks 1–2): Foundations & Data Design
Team Goals:
Lock scope
Understand the building
Define how navigation data works

All Team Members:
Walk the building floor
Identify entrances, hallway junctions, rooms
Agree on naming conventions

Backend Lead:
Create FastAPI project
Define user & schedule schemas
Stub routing endpoint

Frontend Lead:
Create React app
Basic page layout (login → select room → directions)

Data / Graph Lead:
Create node & edge schema (JSON)
Draft 10–15 sample nodes & edges

QA / Integration Lead:
Write acceptance criteria
Define “done” for navigation
Sprint Demo
Repo exists
Sample graph loads
API returns mock directions

Sprint 2 (Weeks 3–4): Core Routing Engine
Team Goals:
Dynamic routing works
Fastest path calculation verified

Backend Lead:
Implement Dijkstra routing
Load graph from JSON
Return ordered node list

Data / Graph Lead:
Expand graph to ~50% of floor
Assign distances to edges

Frontend Lead:
Room selection dropdown
Directions list component (static data)

QA / Integration Lead:
Validate routing results manually
Report missing or bad edges
Sprint Demo
Select two rooms → get correct text directions

Sprint 3 (Weeks 5–6): Authentication & Schedule
Team Goals:
Users can log in
Today’s class destinations are stored

Backend Lead:
JWT auth
Schedule CRUD endpoints

Frontend Lead:
Login form
Schedule entry form (today only)

Data / Graph Lead:
Finish full floor graph
Add instruction text per edge

QA / Integration Lead:
Test auth flows
Validate schedule logic
Sprint Demo
Logged-in user saves a class room and requests directions

Sprint 4 (Weeks 7–8): End-to-End Integration
Team Goals:
Frontend and backend fully connected
Real routes displayed to users

Backend Lead:
Finalize route API
Error handling for invalid rooms

Frontend Lead:
Connect APIs
Display real step-by-step instructions

Data / Graph Lead:
Verify all rooms are reachable
Fix ambiguous instructions

QA / Integration Lead:
Full user flow testing
Bug tracking
Sprint Demo
Login → pick room → get correct directions

Sprint 5 (Weeks 9–10): Polish & Reliability
Team Goals:
App feels complete
Edge cases handled cleanly

Backend Lead:
Input validation
Meaningful error messages

Frontend Lead:
UX polish
Clear instruction formatting

Data / Graph Lead:
Instruction consistency review
Minor refinements

QA / Integration Lead:
Regression testing
Demo rehearsal
Sprint Demo
Stable, clean navigation experience

Sprint 6 (Weeks 11–12): Finalization & Presentation
Team Goals:
Submission-ready
Confident demo

All Team Members:
Documentation
Architecture explanation
Known limitations list

Backend Lead:
API docs
Security explanation

Frontend Lead:
Demo walkthrough

Data / Graph Lead:
Graph documentation

QA / Integration Lead:
Final test report
Final Demo
Live navigation
Explanation of algorithm
Clear future expansion path

Why This Sprint Plan Works:
Every sprint produces a demoable feature

Risks are surfaced early

Data entry is spread out

Integration is not delayed until the end

Fits the 6-hour/week constraint
